Problem set on semiconductor lasers, the relationship between the cavity and gain parameters and the laser L-I curves, the relationship between the spectral properties of a Fabry-Perot laser and the properties of the
laser active region, a low-threshold current laser, and the optical and electrical properties of a semiconductor laser diode.
